- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

###Third, in the folders *test* and *train* there's to collect info signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) from the folder *Inertial Signals* 

- total_acc_x, total_acc_y, total_acc_z
- body_acc_x, body_acc_y, body_acc_z
- body_gyro_x, body_gyro_y, body_gyro_z
